This project focuses on predicting whether water is safe for drinking based on various chemical and physical parameters. The analysis was done as part of the Predictive Data Analytics course (INDE 4364) at the University of Houston.

The dataset includes features like pH level, hardness, solids, sulfate, conductivity, and other water quality indicators. The goal was to build machine learning models that can classify water as potable or not. The project involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and applying classification models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.

The final report and presentation summarize the steps taken, results obtained, and key insights from the model evaluations.
